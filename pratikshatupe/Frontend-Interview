## UI Reference

Here's a reference design for the blog application layout:

![Blog Reference](image.png)

**Left Panel:** Blog list view showing blog cards with category, title, and description  
**Right Panel:** Blog detail view displaying cover image, full content

> **Note:** This is just a reference design. Your implementation does not have to look exactly like this. 

For the blog content, use plain text — no need to use HTML-formatted text.

### Tasks to Complete

#### 1. **Get All Blogs**
- Create a component to display all blogs using `GET /blogs`
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching
- Handle loading and error states

#### 2. **Get Blog by ID**
- Implement single blog view using `GET /blogs/:id`
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching

#### 3. **Create a New Blog**
- Build a form to create a new blog using `POST /blogs`
- Invalidate queries after successful creation

> Organize your components in a suitable file structure within the `src/` directory.

### API Endpoints

The JSON Server provides the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/blogs` | Get all blogs |
| GET | `/blogs/:id` | Get a specific blog by ID |
| POST | `/blogs` | Create a new blog |

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on:
- ✅ Correct implementation of TanStack Query hooks
- ✅ Proper use of Tailwind CSS for styling
- ✅ Integration of shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Code organization and structure
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Responsive design []
- ✅ User experience and UI polish



## Sample Blog Object

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Future of Fintech",
  "category": ["FINANCE", "TECH"],
  "description": "Exploring how AI and blockchain are reshaping financial services",
  "date": "2026-01-11T09:12:45.120Z",
  "coverImage": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/6801648/pexels-photo-6801648.jpeg",
  "content": "Full blog content..."
}
```

description: A short summary of the blog  
content: The full content of the blog

## Tips

- Set up TanStack Query's `QueryClientProvider` in your app root
- Configure Tailwind CSS properly in your config files
- Use shadcn components like `Card`, `Button`, `Input`, etc.
- Handle loading states with skeletons
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Consider using React Router for navigation (optional)

## Submission

1. Ensure all tasks are working correctly
2. Commit your changes with clear commit messages
3. Push your changes to your **forked** repository
4. Share the link to your forked repository for review in the Google Form provided

## FAQ

**Do I need to deploy the code?**  
No. Simply work on your forked repository, commit and push your changes, and share the repository link via the Google Form.

**Is it mandatory to use TypeScript and TanStack Query?**  
Yes, using both TypeScript and TanStack Query is compulsory for this assignment.

**Is using JSON Server mandatory, or can I create my own server?**  
Using JSON Server is mandatory. Please use the provided JSON Server setup rather than creating your own backend.
